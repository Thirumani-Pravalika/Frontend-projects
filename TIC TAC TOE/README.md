# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe Game

A simple web-based Tic Tac Toe game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This was a fun beginner-friendly project to practice DOM manipulation, condition checking, and game logic.

## 🔧 Features
- Two-player mode (X and O)
- Alternating turns
- Winner detection
- Draw condition
- New Game and Reset functionality
- Game result message display

## 📁 Files
- `index.html` – Structure of the game board and buttons
- `style.css` – Basic styling for layout and appearance
- `script.js` – JavaScript logic for gameplay and interactivity

## ▶️ How to Play
1. Download or clone this project.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Player O starts first.
4. Take turns clicking on empty boxes.
5. First to match 3 in a row wins. If all 9 boxes fill with no winner, it’s a draw.
6. Use **New Game** or **Reset** to restart.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- DOM selection and manipulation
- Handling click events
- Checking winning patterns
- Building interactive UIs with pure JavaScript

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Highlight the winning pattern
- Add score tracking
- Make it mobile responsive
- Add AI for single-player mode
- Add sound and animation
